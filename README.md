Cookie Climber is a roguelike tower-climbing battle game where the user plays as a cookie and fights evil gumdrops that get stronger and stronger on each floor of the tower. It is endless, so it is a test of the player's skill.  

Cookie Climber was made in Python using the Pygame module, with the help of the GeeksForGeeks Pygame tutorial, the Pygame documentation, and the Cursor AI (GPT-5). This is my first hackathon, and it was my first time using the Pygame module.  

I am aware that I am the only person on a team called "The Power of Friendship." It was an intentional choice because my friends kept me sane through this whole hackathon.
